Introduction
# given a set of arbitrary numbers, practical solution to make them into groups so that variables within one
# one group is minimized

# For example: [1,3,5,6,7], if we group them into [1,3] and [5,6,7], the sum of (sum of variance within one group) is 2 + 2 = 4.
# If we group them into [1,3,5],[6,7], the sum of (sum of variance within one group) is 2 + 1 = 3. 
# So, the second grouping is better. 

# step 1: define a function that you can feed with list of numbers and also choose how many elements you want each group to have
# step 2: sorted these numbers in lexicographical order
# step 3: divide them into groups based on your choice of group numbers
# Step 4: iterate all possibilities of number of elements in find_optimal function



Limitations
# Besides, I coded in a way that makes one element list impossible 
# because we are not sure how to calculate this one element list. 
# That's to say, whether variance of [6] os 0 or 6? If it's 0, 
# then the optimal of grouping for all list is to make every element a single list, 
# then the variance sum is 0. But if so, there is no point in making this program at all. 
# So, it must be 6. 
# However, I didn't add this situation into my program and may consider to add more in the future.

def grouping(l,n):
    #l is a list of arbitrary numbers, n is the number of groups you want them to be divided into

    for item in l_group:
        gap = max(item) - min(item)
        gap_l.append(gap)

    return sum(gap_l)

    variance_list = []

    for i in range(2,len(ll)): # i represents how many elements there are in most group
        variance_list.append(grouping(l,i))
        group_num_list.append(round(len(l)/i))
    
    #print("As you can see, most groups have",str(i),"elements. So, we get",str(round(len(ll)/i)),"groups!")
    #print("The sum of variables in each groups is", str(sum([i for i in variance_list])))

    vari_2_gn = dict(zip(variance_list,group_num_list))
    min_gap_sum = min(variance_list)
    min_group = vari_2_gn[min_gap_sum]

    print("So, the optimal choice that can minimize the sum of variance are to divide the numbers into",
           str(min_group),"groups so that the sum of variables are", str(min_gap_sum),
          "The corresponding grouping is",list(sorted(l)[i:i+round(len(l)/min_group)] for i in range(0,len(sorted(l)),round(len(l)/min_group))))



Example:
# input: ll = [1,3,15,19,20,6,8,12,23,5,78,32,68,34,1,2,4,23,56,23,86,12,32,3]
# then: find_optimal_grouping(ll)
# output: So, the optimal choice that can minimize the sum of variance are to divide the numbers into 12 groups 
# so that the sum of variables are 42 The corresponding grouping is 
# [[1, 1], [2, 3], [3, 4], [5, 6], [8, 12], [12, 15], [19, 20], [23, 23], [23, 32], [32, 34], [56, 68], [78, 86]]
